		<member name="operation" type="int" setter="set_operation" getter="get_operation" enum="CSGShape.Operation">
			The operation that is performed on this shape. This is ignored for the first CSG child node as the operation is between this node and the previous child of this nodes parent.

		<member name="use_collision" type="bool" setter="set_use_collision" getter="is_using_collision">
			Adds a collision shape to the physics engine for our CSG shape. This will always act like a static body. Note that the collision shape is still active even if the CSG shape itself is hidden.
